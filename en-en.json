What I have to offer you is not for the faint of heart; some lose their teeth, others regret their kamas...","98924":"But if you have a strong stomach, I can assure you that you'll have a great time! Are you interested? Then follow me, it's this way...","71902":"You have to be crazy or stupid to dare to venture to the Isle of the Damned...","29296":"No soul here wants to deal with a living person.","26807":"Leave at once, or you will suffer the same fate as the rest of us!","50799":"Damned souls are prowling around... Too far away from the island of Chafers, they are stuck here, between the world of the dead and the world of the living.","77139":"You can break their punishment, but you wouldn't have enough of a life to free them all...","8965":"If I were you, I wouldn't make too much noise.","80843":"Welcome to the County!","41281":"There is only one inhabitant, a small, friendly man who never leaves his house. Don't scare him if you meet him.","99834":"Oh hello, I didn't see you... I was about to leave for a great adventure! I think...","54776":"Actually, I don't dare to leave home... You, on the other hand, seem to have had many adventures!","78177":"Maybe you could help me gain some confidence? I have enough to attract a few pigs... Show me how to get rid of these creatures!","74159":"Today is a day for adventure... Or maybe tomorrow?","81314":"This tomb must belong to Ra-tepe, the god of travel!","84461":"There seem to be some interesting things buried here! I'm here to find them!","77221":"Oh no! Bandits!","22987":"Don't let them ransack this place, for God's sake!","17235":"TO ME THE TREASURE! HEHEHE\\_! Finally... Almost...","13862":"Kamas... Thousands of kamas... Agghh...","62648":"What... Who are you?! I was there first! I'm the one who discovered the legendary treasure!","57582":"Well, I just don't know how to get it back... They say it's cursed, and that lost souls guard it fiercely...","38899":"Many have devoted their lives to finding it, you know, but it was I, Alastar Gripsou, who finally found it!","77755":"Well, I'm willing to make a deal: you help me get rid of the souls lurking around here, and I'll... Maybe... A few coins... One or two... Not more!","57752":"Look at that! Quite a piece, huh? It's a good thing he doesn't get animated like the Chafers...","6595":"It looked like he was keeping a pretty good haul anyway. Or maybe that's what got the better of him... I wouldn't go near the Kamas if I were you.","11336":"This tomb has been stripped of its valuables for a long time! But hey, there are always archaeologists ready to conduct excavations to look for any relics.","27047":"Ooh... It's always so hot here! No wonder, we are in a corner of the Saharach desert. Or what's left of it...","14918":"Damn, it's crawling all over the place...","4723":"But the warehouse is undergoing a rat invasion right now and I can't get rid of the vermin alone: there are too many!","29433":"I could use a hand: I'll take the left, you take the right.","88494":"Don't worry, your rind is safe here: Pigs don't venture into this land.","72206":"The master of the place sees to it that peace reigns invariably. It is a bore...","17988":"The dojo is the place where the Way is practiced: have you found it?","70151":"Welcome to the Bushido Temple This island is my refuge, a sacred land away from the quarrels of the World.","5245":"Look around you: only peace of mind can bring you to the top.","94721":"Concentrate the mind on the present moment, practice with the soul, and you will progress in the way.","46090":"Focus the mind on the present moment, practice with the soul, and you will progress in the way.","96635":"Look around you: only peace of mind can bring you to the top.","22315":"Welcome to Bushido Temple. This island is my refuge, a sacred land away from the strife of the world.","61618":"The city has several atolls in the vicinity which it exploits according to its needs.","65240":"This is Zartacla, a high security prison island where dangerous criminals are locked up! To escape from here is a chimera!","84921":"To throw oneself into the water here is to drown... It's strange, where are the guards?","15676":"Hey guys, get out! Our transportation has arrived!","29633":"Run away, you fool!","36490":"You'll kindly let us borrow your boat...","32145":"And don't you dare go near the guards! We had enough trouble locking them up!","5124":"*sniff*","97250":"It smells very bad around here... For sure, there are Bworks around here. Be careful.","64834":"You shouldn't stay here, it's much too dangerous....Finally, considering how equipped you are... Finally, stay here, I need your help!","65110":"I am Captain Michel Fieldsco and with my crew we were attacked by the Bworks on the outskirts of the island. We were taken prisoner but I managed to escape, thanks to the cunning, or the stupidity of the bworks.","12089":"Be careful where you step, the peasants don't really appreciate it when we plunder their crops","14165":"Besides, these citwouilles are juicy as can be: perfect for a good season soup! Makes me hungry...","49092":"I don't want those pesky bugs to destroy my beautiful pumpkins again!","22660":"I'd like to reap them all! But there are too many of them","73388":"Didiou I'd reap them all! But there's too many of them...","22259":"If you could do me the small favor of exterminating them for me, by the Twelve or what's left of them, I'd be the happiest","97224":"Isn't this a beautiful little island?!","28951":"A real little piece of paradise, ideal for dates, I hear. I'll never understand that...","87927":"If you decide to climb to the top, beware: the place is well known for its clandestine transit.","16411":"Once on these shores stood a prosperous village. But the Eliocalypse has swallowed it and all its inhabitants.","84262":"Oooooh you got lost? I understand the sea can be capricious. As they say, it is not the man who takes the sea, it is the sea that takes the man!","57279":"But come to my tower to rest, and have a good hot meal. Besides, you're lucky, tonight we have meat on the menu","17853":"Yet a crimson glow illuminates the sky and the sailors who dock there no longer return. No one knows why,","68602":"This island is home to animals on the verge of extinction, due to the Eliocalyspe. They have become rare and coveted.","13306":"You can go and observe them, and don't forget to give them a cawotte.","10185":"There is someone!","58622":"Ahah this time we got them! Look at those beautiful animals, we're going to get a lot of Kamas!","62281":"Shh! We have to approach them slowly...Otherwise they'll run away...","16742":"Bonta has the best warriors to ensure his safety, but most of them undergo intensive training before joining his troops.","81633":"If you think you have what it takes, you can try your hand at it.","35359":"Attention!","60859":"The Bonta training camp only accepts recruits from exception!","72693":"If you survive my training, you will become a soldier, until then you are just a rookie!","70805":"Ten laps of the field and fifty push-ups! Faster than that!","6598":"Here we are, ex-Bontarian tower, that Bonta would like to take back from the Roublards! So a potential future ex-Robberian tower...?","88883":"And... When you finish your work here, could you save me one or two artillery pieces? I hear there's quite a supply here...","40452":"Not another vile Roublar gesture... But it's you!","99941":"What are you doing here?! It doesn't matter, some rednecks are going to fall on us any minute, we have to hit the first ones!","4269":"The Bontarian army needs to take back this tower from the clutches of the goblins, its artillery stock is very important!","23670":"Failure is not tolerated for this mission! Only I can accomplish it, but with your help we have a chance!","43706":"Are you ready? Once the assault is launched, we will have to go all the way! Watch out for their bombs and good luck!","60578":"Here we are at the end of the world, just after it is the fall... This is the only piece of land for miles around!","30326":"It's crazy how many pests there are in this area, I wouldn't want to live here...","19554":"I'm exhausted, friend! I come here to rest in my little island of countryside but these damned pests are invading my land!","31309":"I like to push them away but they keep coming back...","79089":"I can't give up my little island, though... I've only got this shack and my little farm left! Please, little man, could you help me out?","32292":"Damn bugs! They've got to come again!","94596":"This whirlwind will soon swallow us up, so make sure there's no one left on the island and let's get out of here as fast as we can!","19072":"This said, I notice an abnormal influx of octopus in this current, it will not help the whirlpool to calm down...","19851":"Hello Captain Moné, I'm a kind of collector, fisherman, explorer, business-mariner in sum!","51182":"How?! An island swallowing whirlpool is coming?! It's true that the sea seems to be more agitated than usual but it's probably nothing too bad!","72247":"And I'm a reasonable person, you know? As I say sometimes we can defy natural laws but not resist human laws!... that sounds strange when you say it out loud...","61540":"Anyway, it's raining octopus and it's a golden opportunity to make some kamas by selling them to Bonta!","92737":"As long as there are octopuses, I stay here! There's enough for everyone, you know!","84803":"The greatest treasure of all is a healthy mind and a full belly... of octopus!","70185":"I'll stay a little while, the atmosphere of this swamp intoxicates me.","9552":"I've been studying the impact of Araknes on other insect species in this swamp for several years.","57960":"I need to change the devices I put in place some time ago. I'd appreciate your help the swamp seems restless today.","53022":"Arghrgrgg!  Ah I finally made it with this damn device! Only 4 more to go! Let's hurry up, shall we?","78010":"Hey you! Come here and be nice, will you?","61628":"Well, yes, you're seeing someone else.","76108":"Damn device, it's always in these moments that you make me defect!","15875":"Beware, some Rooks are prowling around... They raid the villages and capture everything that moves. An old man like me, think that I could not fight...","44308":"They put me in a cage like a common Gobball! I don't know what they plan to do with me... I've only heard about pig deals...","47267":"?!","78435":"Quick, they're coming back! Help me get out of here!","708":"Hurry up and do your business, I don't like this place, it's not safe...","35380":"It's a transitional place here, but you have to be careful, because it can go up in smoke.","99172":"Damn, how can I not get a hole in my head...","43594":"I need a guy with a face...","38410":"Oh, hey, sailor, how about a good deed?","52799":"See those guys over there? They're ruffians, bandits, pirates, forbans, you name it, but mostly bad guys.","8100":"So here's what I suggest: we'll steal a few barrels from them. That... will slow them down in their plans.","67815":"Don't worry about what's inside, it's not important.","23756":"Well, here's the plan: you do the job, sailor, and they take the bait. Good luck!","73321":"Here we are: quiet little island, great view, big garden, separate toilet from the main building!","49378":"The proportions of the rooms are not up to standard but what makes this island a real bargain! I let you visit!","24713":"I hope the previous owners are gone...","40119":"I thought I saw something move there!","3663":"Alert! Intruder in the area!","11990":"Don't make another Bontarien gesture... human... whoever you are! I've got you in my sights, at the first sudden movement I'll shoot you!","21072":"You are on a private island, we accept no one! Bonta threw us out, we won't be as lenient as they are!","518":"No use turning back, there's only one way out: death!","9913":"The reinforcements are coming, they will join us on the way, you will regret coming to our island!","16240":"All resistance is useless... But nobody ever listens to me...","57023":"It seems that we are not the only ones to have discovered these ruins.","6465":"Be careful, there may be more than one Redneck in the world...","88629":"ALERT! An intruder, behind you!","90877":"What are you doing here? Never mind, you're going to regret having crossed the path of the Billy Clan!","23745":"I hear this is the lair of a dangerous creature, have you seen it?","70277":"You.","31874":"Must.","18400":"Leave.","33607":"It's dangerous.","70495":"Go away.","78302":"GO AWAY!","43608":"Go away...","80891":"Leave this place!","74799":"I think the guy who lives here gathers animals. But I wonder how he manages them all.","86244":"Hello, I'm Honored. Finally... I am of course honored by your visit, but I am, '\\_Honoré_'\\_...It's not serious...","78058":"Listen to me, I wanted to gather as many of Osamodas' creatures as possible in a ship to save them from the waters.","9698":"And after so much work, I have no more wood... But it is not the most serious.","21928":"The creatures I managed to gather spend their time trying to eat each other!","31659":"And I'm spending my time breaking them up again and again. Can you help me calm them down?","26082":"But it's for your own good, I tell you!","60182":"Oh, please, can you help me?","61093":"Poor fellow, he's trying so hard to hold back the water.","550":"I don't know who you are, but either help me or leave me alone.","94726":"Don't you see all the water you're wading through?","51136":"Well, I try not to let anything get in the way, especially my house.","88674":"So either you help me raise it, or you...","83907":"How did he get in... Another infiltration!","44370":"Go push those sea mollusks away, I'll get something to plug the hole!","93901":"And... Cut, scoop and cut, scoop. and a\\_... Little break.","75043":"Who are you?","9643":"Make it quick, I don't like to linger around here.","17327":"Go home, kid. It's dangerous here.","84025":"There's a lot of bags of bones around here, but I can handle it. I'm not an old fart like Oblero.","59789":"Well, since you don't seem to want to leave... I can show you how a hero fights!","10932":"Why? Did you see where you are? In a cemetery! And what's in a cemetery...?","75346":"Here, a young soul. You shouldn't hang around here, the dead don't stay that way for long.","27769":"It's down to an eyebrow this time...","33511":"Except I can't leave this island without my crew!","13094":"I need you to create a diversion, so I can get back to my comrades. Will you help me?","3908":"","40914":"It seems that this island is the cause of many recent disappearances.","3027":"Yet the island looks abandoned, there is nothing but a few araknes.","25501":"No steps! Someone came to save me!","13467":"Quick, help me before she comes back.","21621":"Oh no, she's coming!","41389":"What a lovely forest. Ideal to collect oneself and to be one with nature. Some people even got a little too unisoned.","88868":"What the hell are you doing here!?","87586":"Get out! I don't want nobody on my island!","45513":"I'll teach you how to break into people's houses.","43440":"Hey you there!?","47684":"Apparently some sailors passed by an island where there is a little party going on...","61458":"","98523":"Alcohol and a stinking smell on the way, how about that?","27579":"Alcohol and a stench on a date, are you tempted?","14497":"MY grunt!!! BWAAAARG\\_!!!","31393":"Look at all those lanterns in the sky... They're going up in honor of Jamon, the Piggy Dragon.","81198":"You are standing at the gates of his Sanctuary. But beware: 'He does not appreciate the visit of infidels to his abode...'","97918":"Glory to the divine Jamon, the Pig Dragon!","66216":"An intruder defiles my lands?","96395":"A pig that falls seven times, rises eight times.","66802":"One always learns from victory and little from defeat.","12689":"A Bontaran is a good roaster.","47039":"blah, blah, blah","88685":"Why are we here? I've heard bad stories about this place.","16788":"This is the Fountain of Youth, a place much prized by all peoples.","71635":"Me? I'm only interested in the bounty that bonta offers if we make the islanders leave.","92498":"If you want the fountain, we'll have to go over the water.","98861":"Yessir!!!\n Well said CHIEF!!!\n","86602":"Here is the fountain of youth, a place very much appreciated by all the peoples.","76779":"Me? I'm only interested in the bounty that bonta offers if we make the islanders leave.","94658":"Blah, blah, blah.","98189":"Here we are at one of the trendiest private clubs in the world!","38358":"One more thing, try to be inconspicuous, the owner does not accept individuals... like you...","58990":"Bonta is experiencing this...","66203":"And you, what are you looking for? Adventure or wealth?","42386":"I can offer you both, if you have strong backbone...","71182":"Bonta sends its best Miners there to extract Cracker Stones, but for some time now, very few of them have been coming to the surface...","6254":"Feel the ground shake... Crackers are awakening in the bowels of the earth to the rhythm of the blows of the pickaxe...","85317":"You have been warned.","79457":"","30478":"","36075":"I... managed... to get out of it...","62523":"That was a close one, huh buddies... Guys? Hello, where are you? Guys?!?","33593":"Kamas...","7803":"The more I eliminate, the more come... It will never end...","89543":"Damn Chafers...","80436":"Oh, you're back ! Greetings!","89679":"You want some more?","68624":"HAHAHA! How I love the crazy ardor of young adventurers! Let's go !","74518":"There are others... Not far...","58813":"Always... More... Kamas...","29102":"You again?!","22144":"Creuzard did nothing wrong.","36764":"Creuzard drove to the Treasury!","44866":"Treasures... Creuzard knows there are more!","10630":"Creuzard knows the way...","35703":"A whole bunch... Gathered in one place...","66518":"Shh... don't wake her up!","98542":"Oh no!

To talk, TO TALK!!!</i>","84084":"Listen to plan Vorti:","99953":"Hey, don't leave like that! If we don't do something, the others will get stuck there!","47300":"That was a close one, eh cop...","90447":"AH!!! Oh... What a scare!","34914":"Hey, where are you? Buddies?!?","63856":"There's a thing... A thing... A monster... A monster made of stone... It... He...","28646":"It turns humans into stone! All my comrades have been turned into stone...","16516":"I can't work anymore, I'm so sick! Help me, we must do something!","10725":"The buddies?","60925":"We are the Crackers' Liberation Front and we are here to help them!","87738":"You! Are you a cracker advocate like us?","30991":"Do it for them! *whisper* but mostly for us...","90517":"Free the crackers!","74684":"No to exploitation!","598254":"For the crackers!","6612":"Li-bé-ration!","7935":"For the liberation of the Crackers!","90396":"We're looking for the youngest ones to take them away from all these explosives! *whisper* and because they are more docile...","16398":"We need your help: the adult crackers are too hostile because of the exploitation they suffer, they prevent us from doing our work","10995":"Come back! If we don't do something, the Crackers will eventually disappear!","81214":"We must get them back.","71936":"Yes, there must be a way.","34040":"But without being detected...","67275":"Maybe by sneaking...","42504":"And whispering...","1784":"We have to try, we are too close to the goal!","83909":"There's no time to lose.","79249":"Yes, he's waiting for them impatiently!","70786":"What did the miner say to me already? 3rd left after 2nd right?","64807":"Or 2nd left after 3rd right?","11276":"Raaaah I am completely lost...","48228":"This gallery is really not welcoming...","20870":"Wait! This is not the right way, I assure you!","63496":"You can't leave me alone... here...","76492":"I should never have come here alone...","83315":"What am I going to do? I can't get out... Argh!","8019":"Everything is fine... Everything is fine... Don't worry Gilles...","29832":"I should already be in the tavern, telling my honorable deeds...","73042":"Instead, I'm rotting here...","11971":"Ohoh, an adventurer!","59963":"Hello! I'm Gilles, Gilles Lacarte! You probably know me from my many exploits...","78276":"No? Really... You can find them, as well as some tips that should be very useful to you, in my book entitled 'Me, adventurer: Me, Adventurer.'","612101":"Enough of this chatter! There would be in the heart of this mountain a luminescent stone with extraordinary properties!","71673":"A mystery made for my person, no doubt about it!","95794":"Voice... Exit... Head...","51398":"Voice... Go out... Head...","75693":"Leave... Leave...","32315":"Friend...?","26318":"...","91590":"Help... ?","47516":"Leave...

Get ready, soldiers!","88975":"They're coming, the door won't hold much longer!","53813":"We can accept only one outcome: victory!","91547":"Hail the rebels!","19376":"I am not yet senile! Leave if you wish, I will follow my own way.","84112":"The guardroom must be on this side...","72334":"It must be there...","24955":"What would a knight of Bonta do in this situation...","71075":"Think, Hector, think...","55774":"Oh, I don't have all my strength left... Otherwise this grid would already be history!","82262":"Good old Hector hasn't said his last word yet!","74405":"If those scoundrels hadn't bewitched all those crackers... I'd be out of here long ago...","79025":"What am I saying: I wouldn't even have been captured!","647549":"Rha if only she hadn't been taken from me...","18614":"I'm almost there... Come on Hector, a little more effort...","55925":"Ok Hector, you don't have the enthusiasm of your youth...","44098":"But you can do it! She's waiting for you!","72716":"What... A traveler? Here?!","77756":"At the right time!","32109":"You couldn't have come at a better time: the most precious thing in the world has been stolen from me by the whispering guard.

HAHA\\_!","34049":"Come on guys! No more idle time, we're going back!","600":"You'll soon be one of us. So, you won't exploit us anymore!","20495":"You are an obedient cracker...","50364":"Obedient...","75298":"Head... Free...","4139":"Go away... Go away!","57130":"To me, sentinels!

It's not waiting for you.","79761":"Playing with him is your only alternative.","92407":"I don't know what you're looking for, but I've got just the plan for you!","51122":"It doesn't matter, it's time to fight!","8999":"Bravo soldiers, we can be proud!","26872":"However... You have nothing to do here.","67752":"Who knows where the wind will lead us today...","65846":"Many islands have emerged from the waves you know.","12000":"Come with me, if the adventure does not scare us...","38364":"HELP!","29699":"Finally...
