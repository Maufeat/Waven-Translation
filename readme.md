Welcome to Waven-Translation project! This is a project made by Maufeat to offer an english patch so that non-french speakers can enjoy the game aswell.

# Information

1. Before installing the patch. Check if the Version number ingame matches the patch number, if it doesnt, the patch will cause your game to break and you have to repair your client/replace the patched DLL with the original. 

# Installing

1. Download the latest version of Waven-Translatin from [this link](https://github.com/Maufeat/Waven-Translation/releases/)
1. Inside Ankama Launcher, go to Waven -> Settings -> Game Folder -> 'Open the Game Folder'
1. Inside Waven's game folder, place Ankama.Cube.dll inside Waven_Data/Managed
1. Run the game

You don't need to redownload to get the newest translations. The app fetches the new translation everytime you open Waven, so you'll always have the most up to date translations!
