Welcome to Waven-Translation project! This is a project made by Maufeat to offer an english patch so that non-french speakers can enjoy the game aswell.

# Installing

1. Download the latest version of Waven-Translatin from [this link](https://github.com/Maufeat/Waven-Translation/releases/)
1. Inside Ankama Launcher, go to Waven -> Settings -> Game Folder -> 'Open the Game Folder'
1. Inside Waven's game folder, place Ankama.Cube.dll inside Waven_Data/Managed
1. Run the game

You don't need to redownload to get the newest translations. The app fetches the new translation everytime you open Waven, so you'll always have the most up to date translations!
